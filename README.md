Open README-Generator (now stored on your machine) in your terminal.
Run node index.js
You will be prompted to answer questions about your project. Answer each question. Markdown is supported.
Your README.md file will write to the output folder.
Copy or cut/paste newly generated README.md file to your project's repo. Any edits that you may have (for additional sections, or to remove sections), may be made to this file before uploading it as part of your project's repo.
